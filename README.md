### FHWA
- [A Model Endeavor](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/07jan/01.cfm)
  - cameras --> vehicle **trajectory** dataset --> algorithm
  - traffic **microsimulation** models
  - development of core **driver behavior algorithms**, which is a mathematical model that attempts to replicate the decisions that drivers continuously make in response to other vehicles
  - NGSIM focuses on:
    - when to **change lanes**;
    - how closely to **follow** the car in front;
    - what size of gap to accept when changing lanes or entering an intersection.
  - facilitate transportation decisionmaking
  - Currently, the NGSIM stakeholder team is developing, estimating, coding, and testing the core simulaiton algorithms, using **real-world datasets**
  - the **traffic simulation community** also is using these datasets to help verify, validate, and calibrate newly developed and existing **behavior models**
  - the datasets are the **benchmark** in comparing simulated data with real-world data
  - **NGSIM's objective**: improving the core of driver behavior algorithms in microsimulation software
  - **FLS**: freeway lane selection
  - generalized lane-changing model;
    - step 1: choice of target lane;
    - step 2: deciding the minimum acceptable gap in traffic for making the switch;
  - 3 commercial microsimulation software: PTV's VISSIM, TSS-Transport Simulation System's AIMSUN NG, and Quadstone Parmics
  - trajectory data:
    - I-80 (Emeryville, CA.) &
    - all vehicle positions are tracked at **0.1-second** intervals
    - trajectory dataset --> algorithm --> validating using aggregate data
  - NGSIM team currently is developing three driver behavior algorithms:
    - cooperative/forced freeway merging algorithm
    - arterial lane selection algorithms
- [NGSIM Overview](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/its/06135/06135.pdf)
  - **ITS**: intelligent transportation system;
  - NGSIM provide these products:
    - **Real-world datasets**. The vehicle **trajectory** data are particularly valuable due to the unprecedented level of detail and accuracy: the precise location of each vehicle on a 0.5- to 1.0-kilometer section of roadway is recorded every 0.1 s;
    - **Core simulation algorithms**. how drivers follow each other; how and when drivers choose to change lanes;
    - Documentation
  - Three stakeholder groups (three different perspectives)
    - **traffic modelers group**. researchers that develop driver behavior model;
    - **software developers group**. developing and maintaining commercial traffic simulation software;
    - **model users group**. practitioners who use traffic simulation models for decisionmaking
  - **high-level plan**
    - collecting data
    - developing the algorithms
    - validating the algorithms (using commercial simulation software)
  - Enabling reliable and valid transportation decisions through **improved traffic simulation modeling** is the **ultimate goal** of the NGSIM program.
  - this is a test for Mathjax: $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$
